The project aims to utilize event-based vision to improve daily surveillance for elderly people living alone under low-lighting conditions, detecting accidents in real-time and ensuring timely medical care.

The objectives include
discovering which deep learning model can be used to utilize event data
comparing the performance of different approaches,
collecting more event data/image of human body movements, and training a model capable of detecting human body movements, such as falls or heart attacks.

The value proposition of event-based vision lies in its capability to measure chages in pixel brightness, function effectively under varying lighting conditons, 
and record any event within the camera's field of view
making it highly advantageous for real-world applications. However, specialized hardware and suitable methods to handle event data are required to leverage its potential.
